I"5<p>Between August and December 2016 I worked on my computing engineering undergraduate thesis on medical images analysis in order to develop a tool for
the Segmentation of the aorta artery for applications such as the
quantification of the elasticity of the aorta artery and
quantification of the aorta artery calcifications under the direction
of prof. Marcela Hernandez.
The work has been done in colaboration with prof. Leonardo Florez, from Pontificia
 Universidad Javeriana (Bogota, Colombia), and Eduardo Davila, from CREATIS Laboratory
  (Lyon, France).</p>
