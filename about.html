## About

I am a Msc. Computational Scientist and Engineer from <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>, Lausanne, Switzerland, and a Physicist and Computing Engineer from <a href="http://www.uniandes.edu.co/" target="_blank">Universidad de los Andes</a> at Bogota, Colombia.
I am diving into AI and neurostimulation paradigms, currently performing as a scientific assistant at <a href="https://www.neurorestore.swiss/" target="_blank">NeuroRestore</a> at Lausanne, Switzerland.
I am interested in artificial intelligence, neuroscience, computer vision, cosmic scale astrophysics, medical image computing, education and interdisciplinary fields between computing engineering, neuroscience and physics.
I am also an enthusiast of travel, hiking, science fiction, chess and piano.
